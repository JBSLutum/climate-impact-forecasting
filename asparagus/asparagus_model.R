#Harvest Season####
#This function estimates the yield of asparagus over the season

#accumulated growth potential, if the chill requirement is met, and the season length

#weather influences the quality directly via frost, heat and rapid temperature fluctuations
#and indirectly by prohibiting harvesting on time because of rain or heat
#the fieldworker cant get on the field
