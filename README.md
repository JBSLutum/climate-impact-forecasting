# climate impact forcast for horticultural crops in NRW/Germany
Projection of climate change impacts for horticultural crops in North Rhine-Westphalia Germany.

The goal of this project is to simulate the impacts of climate change for three major horticultural crops. Which parts of the production system are influenced the most and how will quality and quantity of yields change.

This rep will consist of four main folders:
* weather simulator
* asparagus
* crop 2 (strawberries)
* crop 3 (onions?)
